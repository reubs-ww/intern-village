your task is to implement each phase, you can implement in whichever order you want but you must validate that each phase is working.

IMPORTANT:
- ALWAYS update the documents based on implementation status, and also update any other documents incase there are any changes
- you may implement missing functionality if required (but study the specs/* before doing so)
- if integration/property/unit tests are missing you should add them (but choose which one is most apprpriate. follow existing test pattern design)
- VERY IMPORTANT, ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS: once you are done with your current phase and updating all documentations, check if there are any phases left. if have, run this command first `touch /tmp/claude-exit-signal`. if all phases are completed, wait for user input
